I recently tried out a new claim on a group of students: Critiquing is a form of making. That was met with a lot of criticism. Clearly, few students liked my idea that, similar to using and building digital tools, critiquing is a form of making, which is often expressed in terms of ‘making’, e.g. ‘constructive criticism’, ‘shaping an argument’, and ‘a critique resting on solid foundations.’

## Building: A Humanistic Skill or Mundane Task?
There is a discussion in the digital humanities community about the role of *building* in the humanities and to what extent [digital tool building](http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/11/on-building/) should be considered part of scholarly work, on the same level as for instance criticism of such tools.
According to [Adam Kirsch](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch) “[a] humanities culture that prizes thinking and writing will tend to look down on making and building as banausic—the kind of labor that can be outsourced to non-specialists.”

[Stephen Ramsay](http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/08/whos-in-and-whos-out/) argued that digital humanists need to have coding skills, since digital humanities is all about making things.

Kirsch replied: “But are they humanistic skills? Was it necessary for a humanist in the past five hundred years to know how to set type and publish a book? Moreover, is it practical for a humanities curriculum that can already stretch for ten years or more, from freshman year to Ph.D., to be expanded to include programming skills?”

Reading and writing are necessary skills to understand the content of a book. Why would that be any different for digital tools? In both cases, the output is the outcome of the input and the transformations made on that input. Understanding the computational steps that shape a digital tool is a skill similar to knowing how to read and write. 

## Criticism Rests on a Pile of Knowledge
What makes critiquing different from building a digital tool? Both require thinking, both require careful structuring of thinking steps. It seems that these two things are both on a single spectrum of making: while implementing the computational steps of an algorithm is more concrete, it very much requires critical thinking. Thinking seems an essential part of making. 

Another connection between critiquing and more concrete forms of making is that critiquing something, be it an idea, an object or a method, requires knowledge of the *inner workings* of that idea, object or method. 

Anyone can criticize an English novel, but people can *construct* better critiques when they understand English better and make them even better when they have some theoretical background on literary criticism and have read other books. Criticism *rests* on a huge pile of relevant and irrelevant knowledge. 

Critiquing is not just the tip of the iceberg, but permeates the entire knowledge *structure*.

## The Power of Critique 
Critiquing a digital approach to humanities research is no different in that sense from reviewing a paper on theoretical physics. One needs to be intimately familiar with the topic and the methods involved. Should you know how to code to be able to criticize a digital tool or some research based on it? To distinguish valid criticism from invalid criticism, yes, you should.

Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel have made some bold interpretations based on the Google Books Ngram Viewer, which [received a lot of criticism](http://www.culturomics.org/Resources/faq), including from Adam Kirsch. Many such critiques rest on a lack of understanding of the underlying technologies and the underlying data, which *undermine* the value of the critique. The power of critique comes from understanding both the material and the methodology and tools used.

## Do Not Force a Distinction Between Making and Critiquing
This is the core of the Coding the Humanities project. Tools should fit the questions for which their use can provide an answer. Knowing how to choose the appropriate tools requires knowing how they (should) work. Useful criticism builds on understanding *foundations*, *inner workings* and external influences. 

There is no need to force a distinction between 'making' and 'critiquing'. Daniel Dennett speaks about methods of critical analysis as thinking tools. He views computers as thinking tools par excellence, because they help us think through very complex ideas in very small, *concrete* steps. 

Some of the students maintained their resistance against my claim that critiquing is a form of making. Yet, they admitted that a thorough comparison of several digital research tools makes it easier to identify common *building blocks* of tools and use that knowledge to better *construct* and *reinforce* any criticism. I think their choice of terms speaks volumes.
