  Technological developments alter our conception of things, the world, or even the universe. They change your perspective and filter your interpretation of the world around you.

In 1610, when Galileo Galilei was the first to look at the planet of Saturn through a telescope, [he discovered that it had ears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn). But when he looked again a few months later, they were gone. It wasn’t until 1655, when Christiaan Huygens looked at Saturn again–with a better telescope this time–that Saturn’s ears were rediscovered and recognized as rings. Two centuries later, James Maxwell saw that those rings actually consisted of blocks of debris that only *looked* as rings due to their movement.

Later, it was found out that when Galileo failed to see the ears, he’d seen the rings edge-on. His telescope didn’t have enough power to sufficiently enlarge the edge, which made it invisible at the time. Finally, in 2004, NASA’s Cassini Orbiter arrived at Saturn. It’s still in orbit, and sends back new information and images every day. It’s as if we’re there: “[g]azing upon one of our images, we are instantly there, hovering above the rings or climbing the cliffs of Iapetus,” the [Cassini Imaging Laboratory](http://www.ciclops.org/) writes.

## The Relation Between Nature and Man

From Galileo’s early telescope to NASA’s space shuttle, every technological development altered our conception of Saturn and consequently our universe. Walter Benjamin once wrote: “Technology is not the mastery of nature but of the relation between nature and man.” Technology is a mediator. In the case of Saturn, this means that an object looks different dependent on the tool you use to visualise it.

For Galileo, seeing things differently had very real consequences. He saw many more things through his telescope besides Saturn’s ears, and he discovered that the universe revolves around the sun and not the earth. This change in perspective threatened to change the world–the Catholic world especially. To stall the seismic shift that was about to shatter their belief system, Galileo was given house arrest for the rest of his days.

## Your World, My World

Today, many people are fortunate enough to live in a world where it’s encouraged to develop a perspective of your own. When perspectives live alongside one another, they often remain just that: different views on things. Yet, a perspective is more than just a view. A perspective is a filter for your interpretation of the world around you, just as Galilei’s telescope created the context for his interpretation of Saturn’s rings. 

Depending upon the context, my interpretation of the world may differ from yours. 
Most of the time, that’s OK. Yet, seeing an object in a different light (for example at a different time or place, or mediated by a new technology) can change its perception. Consequently, every new device, tool, app, or argument can change a person’s perceptive of something, and therefore has the potential power to alter someone’s world as they know it. It’s something to keep in mind when we make things.
