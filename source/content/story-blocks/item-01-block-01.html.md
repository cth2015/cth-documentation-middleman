Teachers teach, students study. But teachers also learn, and students teach, too. Still, a lot of people see a classroom as a teacher with a group of students. What if we viewed this differently? Coding the Humanities is a collective of teachers, students and researchers who see the classroom as a group of potential teachers. We build a set of teaching practices and tools that leverages existing knowledge and resources. We change the way we see learning â€“ by implementing a coding mindset in every classroom.
