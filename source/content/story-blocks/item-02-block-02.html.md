## Alternative Rules: Impatience, Laziness and Hubris

Coding the Humanities is the title of a course that teaches humanities students to code their own tools for research. Learning programming follows alternative rules. Be impatient, not patient. Be lazy, not diligent. Be bold, not modest. Don’t wait until you know everything, but take what people have learned before you and make something new, Google everything and show off what you learn, as early and as often as you can. 

Art, Science and Technology followed the same rules. The alternative classroom is no longer separated from the world outside it, but is fully integrated in it. It not only uses the knowledge that people bring into the classroom, but takes information that is already out there instead of making its own. As with coding, everything you may want to learn is already out there. Don’t waste time creating new resources, but use what’s already there.
