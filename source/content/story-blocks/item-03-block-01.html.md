Today, almost anything you want to learn is accessible online. Anyone who wants to learn, can use what’s already there. Coding the Humanities creates a tool that helps people structure, track and share what they want to learn.

## Steal + Make + Share = Curate

Back in the day, when you wanted to learn linguistics from Umberto Eco, you had to travel to Bologna. Today, you can do this from behind a computer, anywhere you want, with an internet connection.

Almost anything people may want to learn, exists online somewhere. Instead of creating every learning resource anew: 

- Steal what’s already there
- Make meaningful packets of information
- And share them with people who want to learn

Coding the Humanities set out to a tool that helps you organize learning resources and create a narrative towards a specific learning goal, that you can share with others. 

## Learn, Teach, Repeat

The first step towards this tool was a paper prototype that was made by the students. They designed a system using index cards that helped them structure series of learning resources into meaningful paths. 

Creating a collection of learning resources is a process of learning. Sharing this collection with peers is an act of teaching. The first desktop prototype encourages people to go back and forth between these two modes: you learn, you teach and you repeat.
