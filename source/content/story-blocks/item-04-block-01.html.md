There are many tools that exist to facilitate curation, such as Twitter or Evernote. And there are many tools that facilitate education, such as MOOCs. Coding the Humanities builds a tool that facilitates education through curation.

## Different Tools for Different Means

Students use all kinds of tools to store resources. Teachers use all kinds of tools to share resources. Only a few of these tools are designed to facilitate learning. In the autumn of 2015, we interviewed nine Coding the Humanities students about the way they study and we could describe the following: 

- Learning is telling a story
- You learn best with a clear and personal goal in mind
- Students share little of what they learn or make
- And they are often unaware of the way they learn

We mapped the students learning habits and set out to create a tool that can support and enrich students’ learning processes.

## Organise, Track and Share the Learning Process

Bringing together early prototypes, classroom experience and research, the environment – codesigned with Lifely – became an online space where the boundary between students and teachers is continually questioned and everybody can organise, track and share their learning efforts through curation. The tool embodies a coding mindset and helps you to steal, make and share over and over again.

On the platform, people can: 

- Create, curate and alter hand-picked collections of resources on a specific topic and create a personal learning trajectory
- Gather specific feedback on early drafts of your work and the work of your peers
- See what others are doing and have done before you – in your class, in parallel classes and classes of the years before you

But Coding the Humanities isn’t just a tool – it embodies the further development of a teaching practice that leverages the knowledge and information that exists around us. We believe in a future of shared learning – inside and outside of universities – and knowledge institutions are here to further shape this future of learning.
